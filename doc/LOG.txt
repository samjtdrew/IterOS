Entry 1 - Issue with implementing an NTFS BPB:
I have encountered a strange issue whilst attempting to implement a BIOS parameter block
for the NTFS file system, upon compilation some of the entrys return the error
'warning: byte data exceeds bounds [-w+number-overflow]'. This occurs with entrys such as
'bytes per sector entry'. Under official microsoft documentation, they provide a sample
entry as '0x0002' however, they also state that under normal convention, the value is
512 (DEC), which is 0x200 (HEX). This brings into question the endianess convention of the
NTFS BPB, which is some cases seems to use big-endian notation, and in other cases seems
to use little-endian notation...

Entry 2 - NTFS BPB Formatting:
I managed to implement NTFS at one point, however, overnight it seems to have failed...

Entry 3 - Goodbye NTFS:
Decided NTFS was too difficult to implement for now... Perhaps in a later version of the
OS i can try again, but for now, i am migrating to FAT12.
